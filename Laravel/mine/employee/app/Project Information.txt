this project is same as we made from jquery 
but now we use api and ajax to send data to show it on frontend and all the functionality working on backened in laravel


also we use JWT to tokens you can check them but i don't have time to add registration in this project so i just create routes from it

you can see screenshot of API_tutorials->Laravel->JWT token folder

and use postman to see how it works
